A recent notable seismic event affecting Bangladesh was on March 28, 2025, when a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar. This caused strong tremors felt across Bangladesh, including the capital Dhaka, leading to panic but no immediate casualties reported within Bangladesh. The epicenter was in Mandalay, about 597 kilometers from Dhaka, and a strong aftershock of 6.4 magnitude followed shortly thereafter. The tremors also caused damage and panic in several Bangladeshi cities.

Additionally, a milder earthquake of magnitude 4.3 was recorded within Bangladesh on April 11, 2025, centered near Brahmanbaria. It caused no casualties but is part of an increasing frequency of seismic activity in the region.

Experts note that Bangladesh is in a seismically active zone due to its proximity to the convergent boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, with rising frequency of earthquakes posing ongoing concerns. Significant faults like the Dauki fault and tectonic activity in the Indo-Burma subduction zone mean that a major earthquake remains a serious risk.

In summary, the most recent news includes the aftermath of the strong Myanmar earthquake impacting Bangladesh on March 28, 2025, and subsequent mild tremors felt within Bangladesh in April 2025, underscoring the country's vulnerability to seismic hazards.
